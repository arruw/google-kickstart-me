**Note:** This web app is currently deployed on a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) free plan.
Therefore, application goes to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity, thus it is expected that there will be 
some lag when application wakes up and possible some timeouts.
**If there is interest, we can move it to paid plan or self host it.**

### Contributing

#### TODO
- Add unit & integration tests
- Code cleanup

### Story behind the project
I started competing on [Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) in late 2019 because I wanted to practice problem solving
and to learn new programming languages. Lately I have been playing around in Java and [Spring](https://spring.io/) framework.
Actually, this is my first project with Spring Boot framework, and you are most welcome to do a code
review and suggest any improvements.
